# 🏦 Bank Simulation Project  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Bank Simulation** program models a discrete bank’s operations, including customer arrivals, queue management, and counter service. Users can configure key parameters like the number of service counters and queue limits.

---

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Object-oriented simulation** – Simulates each operation as objects.  
✅ **Event-Driven Simulation** – Processes customer operations as events.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1️⃣ **User Input:** Enter the number of service counters, max queue length, and customer details.  
2️⃣ **Simulation Execution:** The system processes events dynamically.  
3️⃣ **Result Display:** Outputs customer service times, waiting times, and bank efficiency metrics.
